# First Response - Disaster Management Rescue App üåêüö®
___
**Disclaimer:** First Response is a prototype application developed for a hackathon and should not be used in real-life emergency situations without thorough testing and validation.
___
## Overview

**First Response** is a cutting-edge Disaster Management Rescue App designed to enhance the efficiency of rescue operations during emergencies. Leveraging the power of Deep Learning, the app employs custom YOLOv8 and DeepSORT models to identify, track, and assess individuals in disaster-stricken areas.

## Features

1. **Object Detection:**
   - Custom YOLOv8 model identifies people in disaster scenarios and classifies them as normal or wounded.
   - Bounding boxes are drawn around detected individuals for easy visualization.

2. **Object Tracking:**
   - DeepSORT model tracks individuals across frames, providing real-time information on their movements and interactions.

3. **Situation Analysis:**
   - The app calculates the total number of people to be rescued, the count of wounded individuals, and the number of those considered normal.

4. **Resource Estimation:**
   - Utilizes a Situation Level Model (SLM) or a Location Level Model (LLM) to generate reports estimating the resources required for effective rescue operations.

5. **Medical Assessment:**
   - Displays images of wounded individuals, aiding medical personnel in prioritizing treatment based on the severity of injuries.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- CV2 (OpenCV)
- Streamlit
- Ultralytics (YOLOv8)
- DeepSORT

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/first-response-app.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

**Summary:**
In the disaster-affected area, a total of 142 individuals have been identified for rescue. Among them, 17 are wounded and require medical attention.

**Action Steps:**

**Priority Rescue:**
- Rescue teams are advised to proceed with caution and ensure the safety of both the victims and responders during the extraction process.

**Wounded Individuals:**
- Following the rescue of urgent cases, attention should be directed towards the 17 wounded individuals.
- Medical personnel should assess the severity of injuries and administer appropriate treatment on-site or during transport to medical facilities.

**Resource Allocation:**
- Adequate medical supplies and equipment must be brought to the rescue site to address the needs of the wounded individuals.
- The following items are recommended for inclusion in the rescue operation:
  - First aid kits (quantity: 3+)
  - Bandages and dressings (quantity: 30)
  - Sterile gauze pads (quantity: 23)
  - Antiseptic solution (quantity: 3 bottles)
  - Pain relief medication (quantity: 25 doses)
  - Splints and immobilization devices (quantity: 5)
  - Stretchers or medical transport devices (quantity: 3)

**Additional Recommendations:**
- Coordinate with local medical facilities to ensure prompt transfer and treatment of rescued individuals requiring further medical attention.
- Maintain communication with the command center for updates on the situation and additional support as needed.

**Conclusion:**
By prioritizing the rescue of urgent cases and providing essential medical care to the wounded, the rescue operation aims to minimize casualties and ensure the well-being of all individuals affected by the disaster.
